# Flexibility for energy cooperatives

## Research projects on flexibility

* [Flexcoop](http://www.flexcoop.eu/)
  **Demand response for energy cooperatives**
  Democratising the energy market through introduction of innovative demand response tools and novel business models for energy cooperatives.

* [RescoopVPP](https://www.rescoopvpp.eu/)
  REScoopVPP develops a cooperative approach to Virtual Power Plants through open standards, open source software and collaborative licensing of smart energy management tools with high standards for data protection while maintaining independency from commercial interests

* [A community-based Virtual Power Plant (cVPP)](https://www.nweurope.eu/projects/project-search/cvpp-community-based-virtual-power-plant/)
  This project proposes a community-based Virtual Power Plant (cVPP), a novel model that can help organise & significantly boost renewable energy production & distribution at a local level.


## Articles // Reports

* [Flexibility services for energy cooperatives](https://www.rescoop.eu/uploads/rescoop/downloads/Flexibility-services-for-energy-cooperatives.pdf)
  An overview of possible flexibility-based services using residential equipment control

* [Energy communities with grid benefits: A quest for a blueprint ](https://www.raponline.org/knowledge-center/energy-communities-with-grid-benefits-a-quest-for-a-blueprint/)
As energy communities gain traction, questions pop up: Do energy communities deliver realâ€‘world benefits to the operation of the electricity grid? How do these cooperative efforts differ from commercial aggregators that offer similar services?

* [Energy & Flexibility Services for Citizens Energy Communities](https://www.usef.energy/new-white-paper-energy-flexibility-services-for-citizens-energy-communities/)
This paper aims to support the development and harmonization of the CEC role within the energy system and, in turn, help CECs to unlock the value of Prosumer flexibility, to facilitate energy transition. The paper defines the services typically offered by CECs and explores how they might further benefit their members, both now, and in the future, by extending their roles and services to incorporate and valorize demand-side flexibility.


## Webinars / Seminars

* [Unlocking community based flexibility to transform the energy system - 1 (20- 11-2020)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq4PgnkSLM4)
Webinar explaining the concept of community-based flexibility, illustrated with hands-on experiences from energy communities in the field.

* [Unlocking community based flexibility to transform the energy system - 2 (29-01-2021)](https://www.rescoopvpp.eu/blog/webinar-recap-unlocking-community-based-flexibility-to-transform-the-energy-5774fd05-3a7c-4863-9a6f-a50403dfed8b)
"How can citizens be engaged to take a more active role in balancing the grid?" This question was the starting point of our second community-based flexibility webinar. We dug into this question by sharing insights and hands-on experiences from cooperatives and people involved in the FLEXcoop project, which came to a close at the end of January.
